Pull requests are how you merge branches on github

GitHub is a hub of .git/ dir

you can push and pull commits to and from .git/ dir

you can also clone .git/ dir to new computers or paths

master branch is a label that git creates for us when we initialize our repository

HEAD is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit

HEAD is not a branch

#creates a new branch called git-notes
git branch git-notes

#shows us which branch is active
git branch
